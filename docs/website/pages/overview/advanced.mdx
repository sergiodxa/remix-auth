# Advanced Usage

### Custom redirect URL based on the user

Say we have `/dashboard` and `/onboarding` routes, and after the user authenticates, you need to check some value in their data to know if they are onboarded or not.

If we do not pass the `successRedirect` option to the `authenticator.authenticate` method, it will return the user data.

Note that we will need to store the user data in the session this way. To ensure we use the correct session key, the authenticator has a `sessionKey` property.

```ts
export async function action({ request }: ActionArgs) {
  let user = await authenticator.authenticate("user-pass", request, {
    failureRedirect: "/login",
  });

  // manually get the session
  let session = await getSession(request.headers.get("cookie"));
  // and store the user data
  session.set(authenticator.sessionKey, user);

  // commit the session
  let headers = new Headers({ "Set-Cookie": await commitSession(session) });

  // and do your validation to know where to redirect the user
  if (isOnboarded(user)) return redirect("/dashboard", { headers });
  return redirect("/onboarding", { headers });
}
```

### Changing the session key

If we want to change the session key used by Remix Auth to store the user data, we can customize it when creating the `Authenticator` instance.

```ts
export let authenticator = new Authenticator<AccessToken>(sessionStorage, {
  sessionKey: "accessToken",
});
```

With this, both `authenticate` and `isAuthenticated` will use that key to read or write the user data (in this case, the access token).

If we need to read or write from the session manually, remember always to use the `authenticator.sessionKey` property. If we change the key in the `Authenticator` instance, we will not need to change it in the code.

### Reading authentication errors

When the user cannot authenticate, the error will be set in the session using the `authenticator.sessionErrorKey` property.

We can customize the name of the key when creating the `Authenticator` instance.

```ts
export let authenticator = new Authenticator<User>(sessionStorage, {
  sessionErrorKey: "my-error-key",
});
```

Furthermore, we can read the error using that key after a failed authentication.

```ts
// in the loader of the login route
export async function loader({ request }: LoaderArgs) {
  await authenticator.isAuthenticated(request, {
    successRedirect: "/dashboard",
  });
  let session = await getSession(request.headers.get("cookie"));
  let error = session.get(authenticator.sessionErrorKey);
  return json({ error });
}
```

Remember always to use the `authenticator.sessionErrorKey` property. If we change the key in the `Authenticator` instance, we will not need to change it in the code.

### Errors Handling

By default, any error in the authentication process will throw a Response object. If `failureRedirect` is specified, this will always be a redirect response with the error message on the `sessionErrorKey`.

If a `failureRedirect` is not defined, Remix Auth will throw a 401 Unauthorized response with a JSON body containing the error message. This way, we can use the CatchBoundary component of the route to render any error message.

If we want to get an error object inside the action instead of throwing a Response, we can configure the `throwOnError` option to `true`. We can do this when instantiating the `Authenticator` or calling `authenticate`.

If we do it in the `Authenticator,` it will be the default behavior for all the `authenticate` calls.

```ts
export let authenticator = new Authenticator<User>(sessionStorage, {
  throwOnError: true,
});
```

Alternatively, we can do it on the action itself.

```ts
import { AuthorizationError } from "remix-auth";

export async function action({ request }: ActionArgs) {
  try {
    return await authenticator.authenticate("user-pass", request, {
      successRedirect: "/dashboard",
      throwOnError: true,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Because redirects work by throwing a Response, you need to check if the
    // caught error is a response and return it or throw it again
    if (error instanceof Response) return error;
    if (error instanceof AuthorizationError) {
      // here the error is related to the authentication process
    }
    // here the error is a generic error that another reason may throw
  }
}
```

If we define both `failureRedirect` and `throwOnError`, the redirect will happen instead of throwing an error.
