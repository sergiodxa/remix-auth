# Bungie Strategy

This is a [Bungie](https://bungie.net/) strategy for [remix-auth](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-auth) library.

This is based off of the Google Strategy from [remix-auth-socials](https://github.com/TheRealFlyingCoder/remix-auth-socials) and the Steam Strategy from [remix-auth-steam](https://github.com/Andreychik32/remix-auth-steam).

<Callout type="info">
Bungie requires the callback to use `https://` meaning you can't use the default `http://localhost:3000` even for development. The solution that seems to have the least friction and the one I used was the free plan from [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). You can use any solution you like, but we aware that you can't use just `http://`.

It also seems you can't use `localhost` but may need to use `127.0.0.1` or some domain setup in your hosts file. I didn't test this can not confirm either way. Using ngrok produces a domain name anyway, so if that is a limitation ngrok also solved that.

For the sake of this README I will assume that no matter the solution you use, you have a URL saved to your .env file. You will need to update your cookie to use the domain assigned to your ngrok tunnel, if you use that solution. If you have a URL in .env, you can set it to that.

## Setup Guide

<Steps>

### Install the package

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm install remix-auth-bungie
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    yarn add remix-auth-bungie
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    pnpm install remix-auth-bungie
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Create the strategy instance

```tsx copy filename="app/services/auth.server.ts"
import { Authenticator } from "remix-auth";
import { sessionStorage } from "~/services/session.server";
import { BungieStrategy } from "remix-auth-bungie";
import type { BungieProfile } from "remix-auth-bungie";

// you can import User elsewhere to type the profile
export type User = BungieProfile;

export let authenticator = new Authenticator<User>(sessionStorage);

if (
  !process.env.BUNGIE_ID ||
  !process.env.BUNGIE_SECRET ||
  !process.env.BUNGIE_APIKEY
) {
  throw new Error("Bungie ID, Secret and API Key are required");
}

authenticator.use(
  new BungieStrategy(
    {
      clientID: process.env.BUNGIE_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.BUNGIE_SECRET,
      callbackURL: `https://${process.env.CALLBACK_URL}/auth/callback/bungie`,
      apiKey: process.env.BUNGIE_APIKEY,
    },
    async ({ profile }) => {
      return profile;
    }
  )
);
```

### Setup your routes

```tsx copy filename="app/routes/auth/bungie.tsx"
import type { ActionFunction, LoaderFunction } from "@remix-run/node";
import { redirect } from "@remix-run/node";
import { authenticator } from "~/services/auth.server";

export let loader: LoaderFunction = () => redirect("/login");

export let action: ActionFunction = ({ request, params }) => {
  return authenticator.authenticate("bungie", request, {
    successRedirect: "/dashboard",
    failureRedirect: "/login",
  });
};
```

```tsx copy filename="app/routes/auth/callback/bungie.tsx"
import type { LoaderFunction } from "@remix-run/node";
import { authenticator } from "~/services/auth.server";

export let loader: LoaderFunction = ({ request, params }) => {
  return authenticator.authenticate("bungie", request, {
    successRedirect: "/dashboard",
    failureRedirect: "/login",
  });
};
```

```tsx copy filename="app/routes/auth/linkedin/callback.tsx"
import { ActionFunction, LoaderFunction } from "remix";
import { authenticator } from "~/linkedin.server";

export let loader: LoaderFunction = ({ request }) => {
  return authenticator.authenticate("linkedin", request, {
    successRedirect: "/dashboard",
    failureRedirect: "/login",
  });
};
```

</Steps>
