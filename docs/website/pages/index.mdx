![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergiodxa/remix-auth/main/assets/header.png)

Remix Auth is a complete open-source authentication solution for Remix.run applications.

Heavily inspired by Passport.js, but completely rewrote it from scratch to work on top of the Web Fetch API. Remix Auth can be dropped in to any Remix-based application with minimal setup.

As with Passport.js, it uses the strategy pattern to support the different authentication flows. Each strategy is published individually as a separate npm package.

## Features

- Full **Server-Side** Authentication
- Complete **TypeScript** Support
- **Strategy**-based Authentication
- Easily handle **success and failure**
- Implement **custom** strategies
- Supports persistent **sessions**
